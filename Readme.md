# BuzzWire Ultimate Countdown 

*Design of a game using the atmel328 microcontroller for the laboratory of the Digital Systems Architecture*






## Code	

The code in question must be implemented to run a game on the
what is the objective for the user to be able to lead through a maze from one end of the
course before time runs out, to increase the difficulty, when the player suffers a
punishment for touching the barrier. this punishment can be 5, 10 or 15 seconds.

Initially the functions used in the program were modulated in the files
“biblioteca.h” and “game_func.c” where variables, external files and functions related to the game are declared. 

In atmel, the ports were defined: 

- PB1 as the output pin responsible for outputting the ultrasound sensor signal
- PB0 as input, to receive the ultrasonic signal return
- PD2 and PD3 are inputs that enable interrupts
- PD5 the output
- C ports are enabled as output of ports 1 to 5 for the display and 6 to function as the transistor base activator
